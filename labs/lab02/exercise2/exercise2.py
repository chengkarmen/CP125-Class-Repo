# Write your code below:

import math

def calculate_event_cost(participants, tent_capacity, tent_price, meal_price):
    # TODO: Implement this function
    # Calculate total cost for tents and meals
    total_tent = math.ceil(participants / tent_capacity)
    tent_cost = total_tent * tent_price

    food_cost = participants * meal_price
    total_cost = tent_cost + food_cost
    return total_cost


# Test your code here
